{"documentacao_stride": ["The simplest way to apply the STRIDE model to your application is to consider how each of the threats in the model affects each Commerce Server component and each of its connections or relationships with other application components. Essentially, you look at each part of the application and determine whether any threats that fall into the S, T, R, I, D, or E categories above exist for that component or process. Most parts will have numerous threats, and it is important that you record all of them. Following are some sample threats to a Web site. Note that this is a highly abridged list. In a two-hour threat-analysis meeting you will likely be able to identify 20 to 40 security threats.

Review the overall architecture and attempt to identify as many security threats as possible. The objective of this meeting is to identify potential threats, not to solve the problems they present. Create a table that lists the core processes, persistent and temporary data, and communications protocols for your application, such as the following sample table. In the next stage, you will group and analyze the threats to these components and protocols. This section contains: Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2005 Microsoft Corporation.All rights reserved."]}
